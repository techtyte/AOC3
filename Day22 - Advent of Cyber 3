Advent of Cyber 3 - Day 22 {Blue Teaming - How It Happened}

CyberChef and oledump


Question 1: What is the username (email address of Grinch Enterprises) from the decoded script?
{{Hint}}
Navigate to the oledump folder
oledump.py C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Santa_Claus_Naughty_List_2021\Santa_Claus_Naughty_List_2021.doc
The task tells us to select stream number 8 and dump its contents.
oledump.py C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Santa_Claus_Naughty_List_2021\Santa_Claus_Naughty_List_2021.doc -s 8 -d > output.txt
I had to clean up the file and remove the first line (GrinchEnterpriseWasHere), along with some jumbled characters at the beginning and end to make this work!

Next, head over to CyberChef. There's a shortcut in the Tools folder.
Select "Open File as Input" or just copy and paste.
The recipe is:

1. From Base64 (leave all options the same)
2. XOR (Key: 35, Decimal)
3. From Base64 (same)

Done!

{{This will also answer questions 2-4}}

Question 5: What is the flag hidden found in the document that Grinch Enterprises left behind?
(Hint: use the following command oledump.py -s {stream number} -d, the answer will be in the caption).
{{Hint: The flag will be in cleartext}}

Question 6: There is still a second flag somewhere... can you find it on the machine?
{{Hint: The path to the flag is after "$files=Get-ChildItem" in the deobfuscated script}}
