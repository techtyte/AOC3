Question 4: What is the AWS Access Key ID in that file?
{{Hint}}
Append the name of the interesting file to the end of the URL (https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.bestfestivalcompany.com/theinterestingfile.whatever)
Download it, and navigate to wp-config.php, until you see the line that reads:

define('S3_UPLOADS_KEY', '[this is the key!]');

Question 5: What is the AWS Account ID that access-key works for?
{{Hint}}
First, configure a profile with the keys:
aws configure --profile [profilename]
AWS Access Key: [the key that is listed on line 86 in wp-config.php]
AWS Secret Access Key: [the key that is listed on line 87]
Default region name: us-east-1
default output format: [none]

Then, run the command:
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile [profilename]
The answer is the one following "Account"
