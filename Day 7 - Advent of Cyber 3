Question 1: Interact with the MongoDB server to find the flag. What is the flag?
{{Hint:}}

Question 2: We discussed how to bypass login pages as an admin. Can you log into the application that Grinch Enterprise 
controls as admin and retrieve the flag?
{{Hint: Fill out login form with username "admin" and any password.
Intercept the request with burp, and add [$ne] (not equals) after "password".
Forward the request.}}

Question 3: Once you are logged in, use the gift search page to list all usernames that have guest roles. What is the flag?
{{Hint: search?username[$ne]=xyz&role=guest}}

Question 4: Use the gift search page to perform NoSQL injection and retrieve the mcskidy record. What is the details record?
